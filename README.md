# Predictive-Modeling-of-Earthquake-Magnitude-using-Seismic-Data
Implemented a machine learning pipeline for earthquake magnitude prediction using seismic features and a Decision Tree model. The project covers preprocessing, model evaluation, pipeline versioning, and deployment on Streamlit Cloud, enabling interactive and reproducible real-time inference.
